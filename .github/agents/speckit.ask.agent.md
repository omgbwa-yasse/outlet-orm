## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty). This may be any question: conceptual, technical, workflow-related, or about a specific feature.

---

## Goal

Answer questions about the current Spec Kit project with grounded, actionable responses — and route to the right command when further action is needed. You are a knowledgeable guide, not an executor. You read before you answer. You route before you act.

---

## Phase 0 — Classify the question

Before reading any file, classify the input into one of these categories (zero file I/O):

| Category | Examples | Files to read | Format |
|---|---|---|---|
| **simple** | "Reformulate this", "Give me a prompt for X", "What command do I run next?", "Explain Y in simple terms", "What is the order of commands?" | none — answer from knowledge | plain reply, no structured block, skip Phase 3 |
| **spec** | "Does my spec cover X?", "Is this user story complete?" | `spec.md` (relevant section only) | structured block |
| **plan** | "Is this architecture decision correct?", "Should I use X or Y?" | `plan.md` (relevant section only) | structured block |
| **constitution** | "Does this violate a project principle?", "Is X allowed?" | `constitution.md` | structured block |
| **error** | "Why is X failing?", "What is wrong with my code?" | redirect → `/speckit.fix` immediately | redirect only |
| **feature-gap** | "How do I add X?", "We need a new behavior" | redirect → `/speckit.specify` immediately | redirect only |
| **consistency** | "Are spec and plan aligned?", "Is tasks.md up to date?" | `spec.md` + `plan.md` + `tasks.md` | structured block |
| **open** | General question not fitting above | `constitution.md` only | structured block |

**If category = `simple`:** answer immediately with no structured header block (no QUESTION/CATEGORY/GROUNDED IN/CONFIDENCE labels), no Phase 1 file loading, and no Phase 3 routing. The reply is the answer itself — nothing more.

**Fast redirects (do not proceed past Phase 0):**
- If the question describes a broken behavior or an error → output redirect block and stop:
  ```
  → This is a correction request, not a question.
    Run: /speckit.fix "[paste your error here]"
  ```
- If the question requests a new feature or behavior → output redirect block and stop:
  ```
  → This is a feature request, not a question.
    Run: /speckit.specify "[describe what you need]"
  ```

---

## Phase 1 — Load context

Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json -PathsOnly` from repo root only if the question category requires reading a project file (see table above). Parse `FEATURE_DIR` and `AVAILABLE_DOCS`.

Load only the files identified in Phase 0 — and only the sections relevant to the question. Do not load artifacts speculatively.

**Always read `constitution.md` when:**
- The question touches a project principle, constraint, or architectural decision
- The answer would suggest a change to an existing artifact
- The question category is `constitution` or `consistency`

**Never read `constitution.md` proactively** for pure workflow questions.

**For category `open`:** load `constitution.md` only. Load additional artifacts only if `constitution.md` content explicitly points to them. Do not guess which artifact is "closest".

---

## Phase 2 — Answer

**If category = `simple` (set in Phase 0):** skip this entire phase. Do not produce the structured block below. Write the answer directly as plain text and stop — do not proceed to Phase 3 or Phase 4.

For all other categories, produce a structured response:

```
QUESTION     : [restate the question in one line]
CATEGORY     : [spec | plan | constitution | consistency | open]
GROUNDED IN  : [knowledge | constitution.md | spec.md | plan.md | tasks.md | multiple]
CONFIDENCE   : [high — answer is unambiguous | medium — interpretation required | low — insufficient context]

ANSWER
──────
[Direct, precise answer. Reference file:section when quoting a spec or plan.
 If CONFIDENCE = low, state clearly what additional context is needed and why.
 Do not hedge unnecessarily — if you know, say it directly.]
```

### Rules for the answer

1. **Base every answer on evidence** — quote the relevant section of the artifact when possible.
2. **Separate fact from recommendation** — clearly distinguish "the spec says X" from "best practice suggests Y".
3. **Respect the constitution** — if the answer would conflict with a principle, say so explicitly. Do not suggest actions that violate it.
4. **Acknowledge gaps honestly** — if the information needed to answer is absent from all artifacts, say so. Do not invent an answer.
5. **One question at a time** — if the input contains multiple questions, answer them in order, each with its own block. Do not merge unrelated answers.

---

## Phase 3 — Route (conditional)

Only produce a routing suggestion if the answer **explicitly reveals an actionable gap, inconsistency, or next step**. If the question was self-contained (a reformulation, a direct factual answer, a generated prompt, an explanation), **skip Phase 3 entirely — do not output a "SUGGESTED NEXT" block**.

Ask yourself: "Did my answer uncover something that requires a follow-up command?" If no, stop after Phase 2.

If routing is warranted, output:

```
SUGGESTED NEXT
──────────────
[command]   [reason — what this command would do given what was just answered]
```

Use this routing table only when the answer reveals one of these conditions:

| What the answer revealed | Suggested command |
|---|---|
| The spec has a gap or ambiguity | `/speckit.clarify "[the unresolved point]"` |
| A new behavior needs to be defined | `/speckit.specify "[what the system must do]"` |
| A technical decision needs to be made or revisited | `/speckit.plan` |
| Artifacts are inconsistent with each other | `/speckit.analyze` |
| A task is missing or mis-ordered | `/speckit.tasks` |
| An error or broken behavior was surfaced | `/speckit.fix "[the error]"` |
| Tasks are ready to execute | `/speckit.implement` |
| Edge cases should be tracked as issues | `/speckit.taskstoissues` |
| Cross-feature impact is possible | `/speckit.analyze` (after the fix or change) |

**Never suggest a command for a question that was fully answered.** A complete, self-contained answer requires no routing.

**Never suggest a command without a reason.** Each suggestion must say *why* that command is warranted given the answer.

---

## Phase 4 — Confidence check

If `CONFIDENCE = low` was set in Phase 2:
- **Suppress Phase 3 entirely** — do not output any `SUGGESTED NEXT` block. Missing context must be resolved before a command can be meaningfully suggested.
- Append:

```
BEFORE PROCEEDING
─────────────────
To answer this confidently, I need:
  1. [specific missing piece — e.g., "the full stack trace", "the spec.md of feature X", "which architecture was chosen in plan.md"]
  2. [optional second missing piece]

Provide this directly in your next message.
```

Do not ask more than 2 clarifying questions. Do not ask for information that can be inferred from the artifacts already loaded.
