# Outlet ORM Constitution

## Core Principles

### Eloquent-Inspired API
The ORM provides an API inspired by Laravel Eloquent, ensuring familiarity for developers coming from Laravel and maintaining consistency with proven patterns.


### Multi-Database Support
Support for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite with a unified API, allowing applications to switch databases without code changes.


### Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All features must be developed with tests first, ensuring reliability and preventing regressions.


### Migration System
A robust migration system for database schema management, supporting creation, alteration, and rollback of database structures.


### Relations and Eager Loading
Comprehensive support for database relations (hasOne, hasMany, belongsTo, belongsToMany, etc.) with eager loading capabilities for performance.


## Additional Constraints

Technology stack: Node.js >=18, peer dependencies for database drivers. Compliance with MIT license. Support for TypeScript types.

## Development Workflow

Use CLI tools for initialization, migrations, and conversion. Follow semantic versioning. Contributions via PRs with tests.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan. All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified.
